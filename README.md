_NewsApi, React, Redux,Axios, SCSS_

## Description

This application consists of a news app where users are able to:

- Search for a subject of interest
- Browse the latest headlines in their respective countries

## Demo

**[Check it out]**

## To run locally

1. git clone https://github.com/alexmsc96/newsss-React-App.git
2. cd newsss-React-App
3. npm install 
4. npm run

Additionally, you need to add your own API key inside axios.js

### Thoughts

For my second React.js application, I really saw the advantages of using redux for state management.

### Goals:
For the future: 

- better organization of the code
- add a watchlist part for the application
- better use of SCSS variables
